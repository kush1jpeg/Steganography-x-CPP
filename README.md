# Steganography-x-CPP

A cool terminal-based steganography tool inspired by the famous Cicada 3301, the mysterious internet puzzle that appeared in 2012 :Some images posted by Cicada contained hidden messages that could only be revealed through steganographic techniques; written in C++ this project hides messages inside images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique though frucks up the image little bit:)

## üöÄ Features
- Encode a secret message into an image
- Decode the hidden message from an image 
- Supports all the img formats for easy manipulation

## üìå Prerequisites
Before using the tool, ensure you have the following installed:

- **G++ Compiler (or any other)** (for compiling the C++ code)
- **ImageMagick** (for converting images to PPM format)

### üéØ Install ImageMagick
Download and install ImageMagick from the official site:

[ImageMagick Download](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)

After installation, verify with:
```sh
magick --version
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Clone the repository and compile the C++ files:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Steganography-x-CPP.git
cd Steganography-x-CPP
g++ file.cpp bin.cpp converting.cpp working.cpp ppmToOther.cpp -o steg
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Compile all the files using the compiler-
for gcc-
```sh
gcc bin.cpp convertIng.cpp file.cpp ppmToOther.cpp working.cpp -o output     
```
//for windows output.exe file will be formed and on linux simply output file will be formed

Run the output file:
```sh
./output.exe
```


## How It Works
1. The message is converted into a binary sequence.
2. The LSB of selected pixels is modified to store the message.
3. During decoding, LSB values are extracted to reconstruct the message.

Feel free to contribute by submitting issues or pull requests.   (I still have to add the decoding part)
